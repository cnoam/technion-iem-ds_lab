    <h1>Course {{course_number}}: Upload new File for exercise {{hw_number}}</h1>
    <p>This tool accepts ONLY files of type {{file_types}} with a size limit of 15MB.</p>
    After uploading, the server will run the checker with your file. <br>
    The checker will try to build your code (if needed) and run it with input.<br>
    The output of your code will then be compared to the output we got from the reference (secret) implementation.<br>

    <br>
    Upload your code, then see a job ID, and you can check the status of the job from your browser.
    <br><br>

<br>
    At this time, this tool is for your checking yourself. You can use it as many times you need<br>
