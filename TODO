BUGS





TESTS
multi thread access to shared resources such as the database file (pickle)



FEATURES
- add support for LDAP

- refactor the docker images so we don't have gcc/cmake/qemu if not needed (why?)

- refactor the Docker etc. so no need to rebuild the image while debugging (e.g. runners are in hosts' file system)
